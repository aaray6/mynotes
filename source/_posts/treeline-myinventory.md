用TreeLine搭建我的物品管理程序

What is TreeLine?
Do you have lots of sticky notes lying around with various useful information jotted down? Or many lists of books, movies, website logins, personal contacts, or things to do? Can you find them when you need them? Well, I often couldn't. So here's my answer.

Some would call TreeLine an Outliner, others would call it a PIM. Basically, **it just stores almost any kind of information**. A tree structure makes it easy to keep things organized. And each node in the tree can contain several fields, forming a mini-database. The output format for each node can be defined, and the output can be shown on the screen, printed, or exported to html.

我用TreeLine做了一个家里的物品仓库。放在箱子底的东西就可以不用全都翻出来才能找到了。放在冰箱里的东西也可以知道还剩多少。
